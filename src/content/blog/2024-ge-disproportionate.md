## Introduction
Now that the dust is settling on the 2024 general election, a hot topic in mainstream media is the glaring issue of disproportionality.
The Electoral Reform Society has highlighted this election as one of the most disproportionate in history, raising serious questions
about the fairness of our current voting system.

Keir Starmer campaigned on a platform of change in the 2024 election, aiming not only to reclaim seats lost in the 2019 general election but also to attract voters who had never previously considered supporting Labour. Remarkably, he appears to have succeeded in this latter objective. Labour significantly increased its vote share in traditionally Tory strongholds. This success is evident as Labour unseated a record number of cabinet ministers, many of whom were entrenched in these so-called safe seats.

However, there is much more to the story than Labour performing at Blair-1997 levels. On the 4<sup>th</sup>, a historic and unprecedented event unfolded: Labour's popularity actually decreased on average in areas once considered safe Labour seats in an election they won. This is an important development and it's permitted an extreme reflection of our electoral system in real election.
